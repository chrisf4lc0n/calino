# Calino WCG

Calino with a config generator: a fork of
[Calino](https://github.com/Ivan-Malinovski/calino) for easy, repeatable
deployment with Docker Compose or Portainer.

Thanks to Ivan Malinovski for all his hard work on Calino.

**A lightweight CalDAV calendar for the web.**

**Calino is a local-first, browser-based calendar client that connects to your calendar services.** No Calino account is required: the app is a static page, stores its working data locally, and syncs with the CalDAV/CardDAV or JMAP servers you configure. Optional webcal feeds, CORS proxies, AI photo extraction, map links, and hosted fonts are separate network integrations.

If you've been looking for a beautiful, modern browser-based CalDAV calendar that doesn't come as part of a bloated suite, Calino has you covered.

**Try it now at [calino.io](https://calino.io)** — the hosted version, nothing to install. Prefer to run your own? Self-hosting instructions are below.

> **Active project:** Calino is under active development. New features and improvements ship regularly — please report bugs, they're more than welcome!

### JMAP

Calino also supports [JMAP](https://jmap.io/) for calendars and contacts. There is nothing to pick: type your server and credentials, and Calino detects whether it speaks JMAP or CalDAV (servers that offer both, such as Stalwart, use JMAP). Calendars, events, recurrence, reminders, attendees and invitations, free/busy, contacts, offline editing and live updates work the same as with CalDAV. Tasks and journals need a JMAP tasks capability, which Stalwart doesn't offer yet, so those stay CalDAV-only there. If you'd rather use CalDAV on a server that offers both, tick **Use CalDAV** under *Connection settings*. JMAP Calendars is still an Internet-Draft; Calino is verified against Stalwart, and other servers may differ. Details, limits and how to test are in [`docs/JMAP.md`](./docs/JMAP.md).

### CORS and proxy

Due to the browser-based nature of Calino, a web CalDAV/CardDAV/JMAP server must allow requests from your Calino origin with CORS headers. If that's not an option, you can use a proxy URL during setup; Calino provides `https://proxy.calino.io` as a convenience.

With a proxy, requests pass through the proxy operator, so use your own proxy or configure CORS directly when that matters. The hosted proxy sees connection metadata and request URLs, but is designed not to log credentials or calendar bodies. See [`docs/CORS_PROXY.md`](./docs/CORS_PROXY.md) for the hosted proxy's limits and self-hosting options.

Running Nginx Proxy Manager? [`docs/NGINX_PROXY_MANAGER.md`](./docs/NGINX_PROXY_MANAGER.md) has the CORS snippet for your DAV server's proxy host, and how to put Calino behind an Authelia login.

### DAV behind an authentication gateway

Using Pangolin, Cloudflare Access, or a similar gateway in front of your server? See [`docs/AUTH_GATEWAY.md`](./docs/AUTH_GATEWAY.md) for the headers and CORS preflight setup.

## Android app

Like Calino in your browser? There's a native, standalone Android app too: [Ivan-Malinovski/calino-android](https://github.com/Ivan-Malinovski/calino-android). It's built from scratch in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, with no WebView.

This repository also builds a Capacitor-wrapped Android app with OS-level reminders, background calendar mirroring, and optional BYOK AI photo extraction. The AI provider receives the image and prompt when you choose to use that feature. Find the latest APK in the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Ivan-Malinovski/calino/releases).

## Features

I have made it as close as possible, as to what I envision the perfect CalDAV non-enterprise calendar to be, according to my own tastes. I'm simply sharing it with the world. The design philosophy is to have sensible and automatic default settings, that adjust according to your browser and calendar, so that you can use it from any client, without needing further customization.

### Views
- **Month, Week, 3-day, Day, Agenda, Year**
- Click week numbers to jump straight to that week
- Click any date to see it in day view
- Drag events to move them, drag edges to resize
- Vertical split view for tall windows; month shares vertical space with day view and agenda

### Smart Input
- Type naturally: *"coffee with friends on wednesday, at 12-18"* → creates a 4-hour event on that Wednesday
- Press `Cmd/Ctrl+K` for the command palette — navigate, create events, sync, search, settings from the same textbox
- Smart detection: start typing and NLP parses dates, times, and durations
- **Experimental WebMCP** — opt-in browser AI tools for event search and preparing drafts for review. See [browser AI access](./docs/WEBMCP.md).

### Tasks (VTODO) + Journals (VJOURNAL)
- Full VTODO support with due dates, priorities, and completion status
- **Recurring tasks** — standards-only (`RRULE` + per-occurrence completion, no vendor properties), so they interoperate with Thunderbird and other CalDAV clients. See [`docs/RECURRING_TASKS.md`](./docs/RECURRING_TASKS.md) for the wire format and a per-client interop table
- Shows as checkboxes in month view, inline in week/day view
- **VJOURNAL support**, a rarity among CalDAV clients. Use it for daily logs, or deeper notes related to your events.

### Contacts (CardDAV)
- Detects address books on your server and surfaces your contacts
- Auto-enabled when contacts are found — no extra setup

### Time & Calendar
- Auto-detected local timezone with an optional secondary timezone display
- 12h/24h toggle
- Multiple calendars with custom colors
- Compact recurring events (no giant blocks cluttering your week)
- Event transparency (TRANSP) — see busy/free status
- Apple Travel Time support

### Search
- Full-text search across all event fields
- Filter by calendar, date range, event type
- Fuzzy matching with Fuse.js

### Categories
- Organize events with color-coded categories
- Auto-apply categories based on keywords in event titles
- Filter events by category in sidebar
- Categories sync via iCalendar CATEGORIES property (RFC 5545)

### Desktop Integration
- **PWA** — install as a native app. Offline caching is opt-in and requires a deployment that serves the service worker with `Service-Worker-Allowed: /`.
- **Desktop notifications** with customizable reminders
- Sync retry: failed CalDAV operations are automatically retried; manual retry button in sidebar

### Customization
- **Themes** — light, dark, or follow system. Custom themes can be added by dropping a `.css` file into `public/themes/` and rebuilding the app (themes are loaded at build time, not at runtime).
- Configurable first day of week, date format, default duration
- Show/hide week numbers, completed tasks
- Adjust calendar and category colors
- **Settings sync** (disabled by default) — sync your preferences (theme, first day of week, time format, etc.) across devices via CalDAV. Opt-in: only activates when you enable it in Settings → Sync. Uses a dedicated hidden calendar on your server. See [`docs/CALINOSETTINGSSYNC.md`](./docs/CALINOSETTINGSSYNC.md) for details.

### Mobile
- Swipe left/right to navigate between months/weeks/days
- Tasks and agenda work well on mobile
- Optimized mobile view

### Android app
An Android APK is published on the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Ivan-Malinovski/calino/releases) — it is not distributed via Google Play. Because it is sideloaded, Android may ask you to allow installs from your browser or file manager.

For notification reminders to actually fire reliably, some phone makers (Xiaomi/MIUI especially, also Oppo, Realme, Honor, OnePlus, and others) aggressively kill background apps to save battery, which silently breaks scheduled reminders. Check [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) for your device and set Calino's battery/power mode to "No restrictions" or equivalent.

### Security and privacy
- **Local-first storage.** Calendar data, settings, contacts, and credentials are stored in the browser/device storage. Large attachments, photos, and raw ICS data use IndexedDB.
- **Credential warning.** The default local credential protection uses a key bundled with the app; it is obfuscation against casual inspection, not protection from someone who can read the app bundle and storage. For stronger protection, use the master-password setup wizard (`/setup`), which derives the key from a password that stays on the device.
- **No tracking analytics.** Calino does not include telemetry or analytics. Network requests can still go to the CalDAV/CardDAV servers, webcal feeds, configured proxy, optional map/font services, and an AI provider when those features are used.
- **Serverless by design.** The hosted app has no Calino account database or application backend; your configured integrations still have their own operators and privacy policies.
- **Docker hardening.** The bundled production image uses Caddy with security headers and container hardening; see [`docs/DOCKER.md`](./docs/DOCKER.md).
- **Self-hosted account preloading.** Ship Calino with preconfigured CalDAV accounts protected by a master password. Generate the config with `scripts/calino-config.mjs` (or the browser-based `/setup` page) and mount it into the container; changes apply on the next page load. See [Self-hosting with Docker](#self-hosting-with-docker).

### Limitations
- No enterprise features
- No server-side calendar sharing
- Invitations: over CalDAV, attendee details are stored in iCalendar data and can be emailed via a local `mailto:` invite. On JMAP accounts Calino asks the server to send invitations, updates and cancellations (verified between local Stalwart users; delivery to outside addresses depends on the server's mail setup). Calino has no screen for incoming invitations or replying to them yet

---

## Self-hosting with Docker

### With your accounts set up in advance (recommended)

Generate an encrypted config with your CalDAV/CardDAV accounts and mount it
into the prebuilt image. Users then type one
master password, and every account, chosen calendar and `.ics` feed connects
by itself. Changing accounts later needs no rebuild.

```bash
# Make the deployment folder and download the generator and Compose file
sudo mkdir -p /opt/calino
sudo chown "$(id -u):$(id -g)" /opt/calino
cd /opt/calino
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisf4lc0n/calinowcg/main/scripts/calino-config.mjs
curl -fsSL -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisf4lc0n/calinowcg/main/deploy/portainer-stack.yml

# Generate the config (asks for each account, tests it, lets you pick calendars)
docker run --rm -it --network host --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v /opt/calino:/work -w /work node:22-alpine \
  node calino-config.mjs --out /work/calino.config.json

# Start Calino with the config mounted
cat > .env <<'EOF'
CALINO_CONFIG_FILE=/opt/calino/calino.config.json
CALINO_IMAGE=ghcr.io/chrisf4lc0n/calinowcg:latest
CALINO_PORT=8080
EOF
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8080 and enter the master password. To change accounts,
run the same generator command again and reload the page. `/opt/calino` is
only an example path; use any folder, as long as you change it everywhere.

#### Adding accounts from the browser

Accounts and calendar feeds added under **Settings → Sync** (**Add calendar
account**, **Subscribe to calendar (.ics)**) normally live only in that
browser. To share them through the server, open **Settings → Sync → Server
config** and click **Download config**:

- **With a config already mounted**, the download is your current config plus
  the browser's new accounts and feeds, encrypted with the same master
  password. Copy it over the file on the server, then restart the container
  (or just reload the page if you overwrote the file in place). Every browser
  then gets the new calendars.
- **Without a config yet** (the container started without one), you choose a
  master password and the download holds everything in the browser. Put it in
  `/opt/calino`, point the stack at it with `CALINO_CONFIG_FILE`, and redeploy.
  Calino then asks for that master password and takes over the existing
  accounts instead of adding them twice.

Accounts added this way sync all their calendars; run the generator on the
file to pick calendars. The full steps are in the guide below.

**[`docs/DEPLOY_WITH_GENERATED_CONFIG.md`](./docs/DEPLOY_WITH_GENERATED_CONFIG.md)
is the full step-by-step guide**: every generator question, how to check each
step, access from other devices, HTTPS, and troubleshooting. For Portainer,
see [`docs/PORTAINER.md`](./docs/PORTAINER.md).

How it works:

- **Runtime config.** A self-hosted build reads `calino.config.json` from the
  server on every page load. The container serves the file mounted at
  `/calino/calino.config.json` with `Cache-Control: no-store`. A mounted file
  takes precedence over one baked into the bundle at build time.
- **Config generator.** [`scripts/calino-config.mjs`](./scripts/calino-config.mjs)
  is a single-file Node.js script with no dependencies. It tests each login,
  lists the calendars it finds, lets you choose which to sync, adds optional
  `.ics` feeds, and encrypts everything with the master password. Run it
  again on the same file to edit it.
- **Config changes sync.** On the next page load, Calino adds new accounts,
  updates changed ones (password, headers, name, calendar selection) and
  removes accounts that are no longer in the file.
- **Prebuilt image.** `ghcr.io/chrisf4lc0n/calinowcg:latest` (amd64 and arm64)
  is built from every push to `main` by
  [`.github/workflows/publish-image.yml`](./.github/workflows/publish-image.yml),
  with a `sha-` tag per build. To build it yourself instead, run
  `docker build -t calino:local .` in a clone and set `CALINO_IMAGE=calino:local`.
  The upstream image `ghcr.io/ivan-malinovski/calino` does not read a mounted
  config.

You can also make the config in a browser at `/setup` on any running Calino.
See [`docs/SELF_HOSTED_CONFIG.md`](./docs/SELF_HOSTED_CONFIG.md) for the
options and the encryption details.

### Without preconfigured accounts

```bash
docker run -d --name calino --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 \
  ghcr.io/chrisf4lc0n/calinowcg:latest
```

Calino runs at http://localhost:8080, and each user adds their own accounts in
**Settings**. To build from a clone instead, run `docker compose up -d --build`,
which uses `docker-compose.yml`. Site URL, offline support and the other build settings
are in [`docs/DOCKER.md`](./docs/DOCKER.md).

### Run from source (development)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The Vite dev server is for development only; use
Docker or the production build to deploy.

## No-Docker

Calino is a static React app — host it anywhere that serves HTML/JS.

1. Build: `pnpm build`
2. Serve the `dist/` folder (make sure SPA fallback is configured — see below)

Most user data, including CalDAV account metadata and credentials, lives in the browser's `localStorage`; large raw ICS documents, attachments, and contact photos use IndexedDB. There is no backend or central Calino application server.

For a private-network deployment that must connect directly to a plain-HTTP
CalDAV server, build with `CALINO_SELF_HOSTED=true pnpm build`. The DAV server
must allow the Calino origin through CORS. HTTP transmits credentials and
calendar data without encryption, and an HTTPS-hosted Calino may still be
blocked by the browser's mixed-content policy; see
[`docs/DOCKER.md`](./docs/DOCKER.md#content-security-policy).

**Config (in-app):** Click the gear icon or use `Cmd/Ctrl+K` → "Settings" → add your CalDAV server URL, username, and password.

**Site URL (for SEO / Open Graph cards):**

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and set VITE_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
pnpm build
```

`VITE_SITE_URL` is baked into `index.html` at build time and used for the canonical link, Open Graph / Twitter cards, and the JSON-LD structured-data block.

### Online Deployment

Calino is a Vite SPA. Any static host works as long as it rewrites all unknown paths to `/index.html` (so client-side routes like `/week` and `/day` resolve on refresh).

**GitHub Pages** — the repository workflow deploys the project site for the
upstream repository. For a fork, update the workflow's `VITE_SITE_URL` and
the Vite `base` path if you are deploying under a project subpath, enable
Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**, then push to `main`. A custom
domain or a host that serves the app at `/` does not need a subpath base.

**Caddy** (example):
```caddy
yourcaldav.server.com {
    @cors method OPTIONS

    handle @cors {
        header {
            Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" # or your selfhosted Calino instance URL
            Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, REPORT, OPTIONS, MKCOL, MKCALENDAR, COPY, MOVE"
            Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Authorization, Content-Type, Depth, Prefer, If-None-Match, If-Match"
            Access-Control-Expose-Headers "ETag"
        }
        respond "" 204
    }

    header {
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
        Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, REPORT, OPTIONS, MKCOL, MKCALENDAR, COPY, MOVE"
        Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Authorization, Content-Type, Depth, Prefer, If-None-Match, If-Match"
        Access-Control-Expose-Headers "ETag"
        -Server
    }

    reverse_proxy 192.168.1.1:89 # your caldav server IP and port
}
```

> **Tip:** Replace `*` with your Calino origin in production (e.g. `https://calendar.example.com`) to avoid letting arbitrary sites read your calendar.

**Service Worker / Offline Mode:** The service worker is disabled by default. To enable offline support, build with `CALINO_ENABLE_SW=true` and make sure the final host serves `/sw.js` with `Service-Worker-Allowed: /`. The service worker caches the app shell; CalDAV synchronization still needs network access. See [`docs/DOCKER.md`](./docs/DOCKER.md) for Docker setup.

### Supported Servers
- Baikal
- Nextcloud Calendar
- Radicale
- Any RFC 4791 compliant CalDAV server
- JMAP: Stalwart (tested); any server that implements JMAP Calendars should work, but the specification is still a draft

### CORS Headers

If adding headers to your CalDAV server:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <your-calino-origin>
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type, Depth, If-Match, If-None-Match
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, REPORT, OPTIONS, MKCOL, MKCALENDAR, COPY, MOVE
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag, DAV, Allow
```

> **Tip:** If something isn't working, don't guess at which header is missing — open **Settings → Sync**, pick your account and press **Diagnose**. Calino probes the server check by check and tells you what to change. Note that browsers hide a server's `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers from JavaScript, so some verdicts are marked "inferred": they're deduced from how the server behaved rather than read off the wire. Exposing `DAV` and `Allow` (above) lets Calino read those two directly.

> **JMAP servers** need the same headers on their API endpoints, not just `/.well-known/jmap`; Stalwart answers CORS only on the latter unless **Use permissive CORS** is enabled (see [`docs/JMAP_TESTING.md`](./docs/JMAP_TESTING.md)). Allow `POST`, expose `WWW-Authenticate` and `Retry-After` as well, and note that live updates use `EventSource`, which can't send an `Authorization` header cross-origin; Calino reads the event stream with `fetch` instead.

> **Note:** `MKCOL`, `COPY`, and `MOVE` are required for settings sync (creating/moving the Calino settings collection). Omitting them still lets calendars load, but settings sync will fail.

> **Note:** `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag` is optional but worth setting. Without it the browser hides the `ETag` your server returns on every write, and Calino has to spend an extra PROPFIND per write to recover it.

### Self-Hosting a CORS Proxy

If you can't add CORS headers to your CalDAV server, run a tiny proxy yourself. The easiest option is the bundled Docker proxy — enable it alongside Calino with a compose profile:

```bash
docker compose --profile proxy up -d
```

This pulls the published multi-architecture `calino-proxy` image (and falls
back to the local `proxy/` build context if it is unavailable). Then set the
**Proxy URL** in Calino settings to `http://<your-host>:8081`. It's a separate,
zero-dependency container that you can also run standalone or as a Cloudflare
Worker. See [`docs/CORS_PROXY.md`](./docs/CORS_PROXY.md) for all options.

For an internet-facing proxy, do not leave the defaults open: set both
`CALINO_PROXY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and `CALINO_PROXY_ALLOWED_TARGETS` to your
Calino origin and CalDAV host(s). Put the proxy behind HTTPS as well. These
restrictions reduce open-relay and SSRF risk; see [`docs/CORS_PROXY.md`](./docs/CORS_PROXY.md).
